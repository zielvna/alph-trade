## Overview 📝

This is a synthetic perpetual futures exchange. Traders can open long or short positions on three different tokens: BTC, ETH, and ALPH (with more to come in the future) with up to 20x leverage. Liquidity providers can deposit tokens into the liquidity pool to earn fees, as well as profit or loss (P&L) from the positions traders open.
